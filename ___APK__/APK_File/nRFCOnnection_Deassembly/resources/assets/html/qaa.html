    <h1>Answers:</h1>
    <li>
        <h2 id="qg1">What does the application do?</h2>
        The nRF Connect is an application that lets you scan, discover, and debug your
        Bluetooth Low Energy devices.
        It displays the list of advertising devices and allows you to connect to them, and read
        and write data. You must have
        a Bluetooth 4.0+ device in order to make use of the application.
    </li>
    <li>
        <h2 id="qg2">How it uses the required permissions?</h2>
        The application currently requires the following permissions:
        <ul>
            <li>fine location</li>
            Since Android 6.0 Marshmallow this permission is required in order to scan for Bluetooth LE devices.
            Also, the Location service must be enabled. This is due to a fact, that the small tags, known as beacons,
            may be used to track user's location.
            <li>access Bluetooth settings, pair with Bluetooth devices</li>
            Application scans for Bluetooth Low Energy devices, lets you connect to them, send and
            receive data, and bond.
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h2 id="qg3">Is the application free?</h2>
        Yes. The application is available on Google Play free of charge.
    </li>
    <li>
        <h2 id="qg4">Is the source code available?</h2>
        No, the source code is not available. If you would like to suggest some change, report a bug
        or make a feature request please contact us using the "Send feedback" button in the menu.
        If you are interested in a sample code, we've released the source code of our other
        applications (e.g. nRF Toolbox, nRF Blinky) for Android and iOS on GitHub.
        Please, go to <a href="https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor">GitHub/NordicSemiconductor</a> for more information.
    </li>
    <li>
        <h2 id="qal1">Why can't I see my device on the list?</h2>
        The nRF Connect application scans for all Bluetooth LE devices in the range.
        Your device may not be visible on the list if at least one of the following statements is true:
        <ul>
            <li>the device does not support Bluetooth 4.0+</li>
            <li>the device is already connected to another device</li>
            <li>the device is bonded to another device</li>
            <li>Bluetooth adapter is disabled or not available on the phone/tablet</li>
            <li>the location permission is not granted or the location service is disabled</li>
            <li>a Bluetooth error occurred on the Android system</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h2 id="qal2">How can I see the advertising data of the device?</h2>
        Click on the device row to expand it and see the advertising data in an accessible form.
        Click on the RAW button to see the unformatted raw data. The MORE button shows detailed advertising history.
    </li>
    <li>
        <h2 id="qal3">Why some rows in the device details have blue label?</h2>
        Some data in the advertising packet may be parsed in different ways. nRF Connect gives you an
        option to change the parser assigned to this value by
        clicking a row with blue label. List of available parsers varies and depends on the value
        length and format.
    </li>
    <li>
        <h2 id="qal4">Can I clear the list of devices?</h2>
        Yes. Use the refresh item from the menu or pull the list of devices down.
    </li>
    <li>
        <h2 id="qal5">Can I filter the list of devices?</h2>
        Yes, click the "No filter" on the SCANNER tab to expand a filter view. You may filter devices by the address, name and highest
        required RSSI. You may also mark a device as favorite by pressing its icon on the left. An orange star indicates that it's favorite and will be shown.
    </li>
    <li>
        <h2 id="qal6">What is the RSSI?</h2>
        The RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indication) is a measurement of the power present in a
        received radio signal. It's usually displayed
        in dBm (Decibel-milliwatts). Low power devices, like Bluetooth Low Energy devices, are using very
        week power to transfer data, therefore the usual values
        of RSSI are between -100dBm (very week signal) to around -20 dBm (strong signal).
    </li>
    <li>
        <h2 id="qal7">Why the RSSI values are different on two Android devices?</h2>
        By definition the RSSI value is a measurement of the power present in received radio signal.
        The signal strength depends on the antennas,
        device orientation, location, distance from the phone to the target device, humidity etc.
    </li>
    <li>
        <h2 id="qal8">Why the RSSI graph ends few seconds after it has been found?</h2>
        On some phones (f.e. Nexus 4 and Nexus 7) the application is being notified only about the
        first advertising packet received during one
        scanning. This value is being shown on the graph. After few seconds, when no more packets
        are received, the graph ends for this device.
        You may disable continuous scanning in Settings-&gt;Scanner. When disabled the application
        will scan in 1 second periods which will
        keep the graph going. This option should be enabled if your phone/tablet does not have this
        issue.
    </li>
    <li>
        <h2 id="qal9">Can I copy the advertising data to another application?</h2>
        Yes. Long-press the row you want to copy to go to selection mode. You may select more device
        while in selection mode by pressing other rows.
        Click COPY or SHARE icon to copy the devices' data to your application or select the SAVE
        option to save it in a file. You may also
        export the advertising data to the nRF Logger application.
    </li>
    <li>
        <h2 id="qal10">Can I export the graph to EXCEL or CSV format?</h2>
        Yes. Please, long-press the row you want to copy to go to selection mode.
        You may select more device while in selection mode by pressing other rows. Press on the SAVE
        menu and select desired format.
    </li>
    <li>
        <h2 id="qaa1">Why the advertiser is not supported?</h2>
        The advertiser API is available since Android 5.0 Lollipop. However, not all devices with this system version support it.
        You may quickly find out which features your devices support in the Device Information page (open it from the navigation menu).
        Be sure you have the Bluetooth adapter enabled.
    </li>
    <li>
        <h2 id="qaa2">How can I start advertising?</h2>
        You have to create an advertising packet. It can be done in two ways: a creator (click on the floating red button with +), or by cloning
        a scanned device (expand its row and click CLONE button). After the packet was created it can be edited using the EDIT button.
        To start advertising make sure the Bluetooth adapter is enabled and switch the ON/OFF switch on the packet row to ON position.
    </li>
    <li>
        <h2 id="qaa3">Why the device name is different then I have set?</h2>
        Android API does not allow to advertise with a custom device name. It allows only to add or not to add a phone's name. The phone's name can be set in
        the top menu. The 'Display name' field is used just to display the packets on the ADVERTISER tab.
    </li>
    <li>
        <h2 id="qaa4">Why I can't connect to an advertising Android device?</h2>
        Make sure you have set the 'Connectable' switch in the packet editor. A cloned packet, on Android version before 8, by default is set as non-connectable. Since Oreo the flag is copied from the cloned packet.
    </li>
    <li>
        <h2 id="qaa5">What's the difference between Advertising data and Scan Response data?</h2>
        In Bluetooth 4+ a device, if not connected, continuously advertises with the Advertising data. When a scanner receives it, it may send the Scan request packet
        to obtain more advertising information. Then, the advertising device sends the Scan response data. Both packets may have up to 31 bytes.
    </li>
    <li>
        <h2 id="qaa6">The app does not advertise with data I specified. Why?</h2>
        Most probably it's because of an Android bug. Up to now (Android 6.0) only a single Service Data or Manufacturer Data are being advertised
        in the Advertising Data or the Scan Response data.
        This means you may have up to 2 of each, a single S-D and M-D in Advertising Data, and another pair in the Scan Response data.
    </li>
    <li>
        <h2 id="qaa7">The app advertise with old data that I have removed. Why?</h2>
        Just like in the previous question it is an Android bug. If you had set the Scan Response data, and then removed it, some devices (all we used for testing)
        advertise with the last value, even though the null is passed as Scan Response. Try to reset the Bluetooth or the Android device.
    </li>
    <li>
        <h2 id="qa11">What does autoConnect mean?</h2>
        When connected with autoConnect the Android will try to establish connection whenever the device is in range. Please, refer to
        <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/bluetooth/BluetoothDevice.html#connectGatt%28android.content.Context,%20boolean,%20android.bluetooth.BluetoothGattCallback%29">Android
            documentation</a> for more information.
    </li>
    <li>
        <h2 id="qa12">How can I bond to the device?</h2>
        You may bond to a device in 4 ways:
        <ul>
            <li>Press the three white dots on the CONNECT button to show the connection options.
                Click the Bond item.
            </li>
            <li>Connect to the device by pressing CONNECT button and wait until the device connects.
                Click the Bond item in the menu.
            </li>
            <li>Try to read or write something to a secured characteristic or descriptor.</li>
            <li>Go to Android settings-&gt;Bluetooth and click on the device you want to bond.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h2 id="qa13">Can I connect to more than one device at once?</h2>
        Yes, simple go back to the SCANNER tab and connect with another device. The maximum number
        of simultaneous connections depends on the phone/tablet and is usually 6 or more.
        You may also scan for devices or advertise (supported on newer devices with Android Lollipop
        or newer) at the same time.
    </li>
    <li>
        <h2 id="qa14">Can I save or export the log?</h2>
        Yes. If you have the
        <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=no.nordicsemi.android.log">nRF Logger</a> application
        installed on your phone/tablet the log session may be saved automatically. See Settings-&gt;Logger
        for more options. If you are not interested
        in this application you may always save the log to a file, copy it or share it using the
        menu below be log.
    </li>
    <li>
        <h2 id="qa15">How can I enable all notifications at once?</h2>
        When connected open the device menu and select Enable services. You may also read all
        characteristics at once. Those operations may take some time
        depending on the interval connection of the device and number of characteristics.
    </li>
    <li>
        <h2 id="qa16">How can I write any bytes to a characteristic with a custom writer?</h2>
        nRF Connect has build in parsers and writers for number of characteristics. If
        you want to disable this feature and use the default dialog uncheck the
        "Parse known characteristics" option in the menu.
    </li>
    <li>
        <h2 id="qao1">What is the DFU?</h2>
        DFU (Device Firmware Update) is a protocol used to transfer an updated version of the
        application, SoftDevice or a Bootloader on a nRF5x chip
        Over-the-Air. Please, see the documentation for more details: <a
